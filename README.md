From this point on the Java and .Net reference implementations will be splitting their projects into releasable components.  For example both Java and .Net have libraries such as Agent, Common and DNSResponder.  So the new projects will be named by the following pattern.

Java.Agent
Java.Common
Java.DSNResponder

DotNet.Agent
DotNet.Common
DotNet.DSNResponder
